## Key Principles

### ✓ DO:
- Understand the iterative research process (Kothari framework)
- Use templates as guides, not rigid structures
- Document everything as you go, including iterations
- Expect to cycle back through research phases
- Keep raw and processed data separate
- Back up your work regularly (3-2-1 rule)
- Version control your code and important documents
- Ask for feedback early and often
- Be honest about limitations
- Follow the research methodology guide

### ✗ DON'T:
- Don't fabricate or manipulate data
- Don't skip validation steps
- Don't wait until the end to start writing
- Don't ignore negative results
- Don't overstate your contributions
- Don't plagiarize (cite everything properly)
- Don't work in isolation (communicate with advisor)

## Notes

This folder structure and templates are designed to guide you through the thesis process systematically. The templates are frameworks - adapt them to your specific needs and your advisor's preferences.

Remember:
- **Quality over quantity** - A focused, rigorous study is better than broad, shallow work
- **Reproducibility matters** - Document everything thoroughly
- **Limitations are normal** - Every study has them; acknowledge them honestly
- **Your contribution is unique** - Even if incremental, it advances the field

**Good luck with your research!**
