## How to Use This Framework

### Option 1: Use as Template (Recommended)
1. **Fork or download** this repository
2. **Rename** `Test_Thesis_Topic_01/` to match your thesis topic
3. **Customize** the content in each folder for your specific research
4. **Follow** the phase-by-phase guide in the main README

### Option 2: Study the Structure
1. Browse through the folders to understand the organization
2. Read the templates to see what each phase requires
3. Adapt the structure to fit your institution's requirements
4. Create your own version based on this example

## Key Features

## Who Should Use This

This framework is designed for:

- **Master's students** starting their thesis research
- **Graduate advisors** looking for structured guidance for students
- **Research groups** wanting a standardized thesis organization
- **Academic institutions** developing thesis guidelines

## Applicable Research Areas

While the example focuses on electric vehicle control systems, this framework is applicable to:

- Control Systems Engineering
- Robotics and Automation
- Computer Science and AI/ML
- Electrical and Electronic Engineering
- Mechanical Engineering
- Any technical research requiring simulation/implementation

## Getting Started

1. **Read** [Test_Thesis_Topic_01/README.md](Test_Thesis_Topic_01/README.md) for the complete guide
2. **Start with** Phase 1: [Problem Definition](Test_Thesis_Topic_01/01_Problem_Definition/01_Research_Topic.md)
3. **Follow** the timeline and checkpoints
4. **Adapt** the templates to your specific needs

## Key Principles

### Research Organization
- Systematic folder structure for all research materials
- Version control for code and documents
- Clear separation of raw data, processed data, and analysis

### Documentation
- Document everything as you progress
- Maintain detailed research notebooks
- Keep track of decisions and rationale

### Quality Focus
- Follow rigorous research methodology
- Validate results thoroughly
- Report findings honestly (including negative results)

### Time Management
- Start writing early, not at the end
- Set regular milestones and deadlines
- Build in buffer time for unexpected issues

## Timeline Overview

**Year 1:**
- Semester 1: Topic selection, literature review, methodology design
- Semester 2: Implementation, initial testing, preliminary results

**Year 2:**
- Semester 3: Full experiments, data collection, analysis
- Semester 4: Writing, revisions, defense preparation

## Tools and Resources Mentioned

### Reference Management
- Zotero (recommended)
- Mendeley
- EndNote

### Writing
